## How to print slides to pdf

```bash
jupyter-nbconvert --to slides --SlidesExporter.reveal_url_prefix='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/reveal.js/3.5.0/' ST445_wk1_admin.ipynb
```
Then:
* rename the output file to change the space before `slides` to an underscore
* browse the file in Chrome using (e.g.)
    ```
    file:///Users/kbenoit/Dropbox/GitHub/lse-st445/lectures/week01/ST445_wk1_admin.slides.html?pdf-preview#/
    ```
* Print to Preview (Mac) or just print to pdf in Landscape A4 mode, without headers and footers
