## ST445 Managing and Visualizing Data

# Exercise 1: Working with Git and GitHub

1.  Get started with GitHub.

    * Install git

      If you do not have a git client installed on your system, you will need to [get one here](https://git-scm.com/download/gui) and also to make sure that [git is installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

    * Set up an account on GitHub, if you have not already done so.

    * Send us your GitHub account name.

2.   Install Anaconda, so that you can run Jupyter notebooks on your local client.

        You can install the R system at the Terminal using:
        ```bash
        conda install r-essentials
        ```

3.  Practice the class workflow.

    *   Clone the lectures repository.

        You can "clone" repository, using the buttons found to the right side of your browser window as you view this repository.  This is the button labelled "Clone in Desktop".  You can also use command line git to do this, or use a GUI client for git.

    *  Fork and correct the [broken R example](https://github.com/lse-st445/lectures/blob/master/week01/R_example.ipynb), and issue a Pull Request.


4.  Create a personal web page.

    Clone a website repository, modify it, and publish a personal webpage.  Follow the steps described in:

    Jim McGlone, "[Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub:
     A step-by-step beginner's guide to creating a personal website and blog using Jekyll and hosting it for free using GitHub Pages.](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)".
